# 🦷 Teeth Classification using Deep Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a *comprehensive computer vision solution* for *teeth classification*.  
The objective is to preprocess and visualize dental images, then build and train a robust deep learning model to classify teeth into *7 distinct categories*.  

Accurate teeth classification plays a vital role in:
- 🏥 Enhancing diagnostic precision  
- 🤖 Supporting AI-driven dental solutions  
- 😀 Improving patient outcomes in healthcare  

---

## 🗂 Dataset
- Images of teeth (preprocessing required).  
- 7 distinct classes for classification.  
- Dataset balance and class distribution to be analyzed during visualization.  

---

## ⚙ Preprocessing
- *Normalization*: Ensure consistent pixel value ranges.  
- *Augmentation*: Apply transformations (flip, rotation, zoom, etc.) to improve model generalization.  
- *Visualization*:  
  - Show class distribution (to check dataset balance).  
  - Display images before and after augmentation.  

---

## 🧠 Model Architecture
- Framework: *TensorFlow* or *PyTorch*  
- *Custom CNN model* designed for teeth classification.  
- Trained to establish a *baseline performance*.  
- Baseline will serve as a foundation for future improvements and optimization.  

---

## 📊 Evaluation
The model performance will be assessed using:
- *Accuracy*  
- *Precision*  
- *Recall*  
- *F1-Score*
